Explination of Graph NN and its Algo:

First and formost we need a way to represent the structure of the graph so for that we use an Adjecey Matrix. 
Now what is in each of the nodes? For that each node has a feature vector that represents the message it would like to pass.
Next each node will pass its information to the adjacent matrixes. What if a node recives many message? How do we combine?
That can be done many ways like taking the sum or avg or mean. In our code we will Avg.
The full equation is as such (W H)to transfrom inputs to the message then that time the adjacecy matrix (A+I) so we now send our own message also to ourself.
Then we multiply do the Diagonal Matrix D which denotes the num neibrs the node has to make the avg and finaly we pass it thorough a non linearity.
